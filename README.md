It's a trash, what more do you expect? Peek inside at your own risk. the bad, rotten codes, files, folders smell bad.
GIT and GITHUB


*Version Control- It is a system which stores all the changes or manipulation done to file/code which give us the ability to store, restore the changes made to the file/code. It provides many feature such as collaboration with other users on your data
REPOSITORY: It is just like a database which stores all your files and folders
COMMIT: Saving; whenever you commit it saves the current file while also storing the changes made and displays a commit 'some_number' on the repository page. The number basically tells us that how many saves or commits were made along with a hash number which can be used to rollback to the previous commit.
BRANCHES:
 
Fellas! if you hear noobs saying 'open source project' to sound 'kakoi' (cool; yes, im a weeb it basically means that the code or repo can be forked and changes can be made to it. Once you're done distrupting someone else's repo you can request a pull request(confused?), yeah it doesnt make sense, you get the gist tho, right? 
What is the diff bw B and F you ask? Basically, with branches every changes can be made in a sinlge place ie a base repo or your repo whereas fork requries two or more repo, yours and hoodie_wearing_coder.
